I\'m starting this project to make it easier to create academic personal websites.
I\'m doing this because I know first-hand that creating a website is hard and time-consuming.
When I was in graduate school, I spent a lot of time working on [my personal website](http://ianli.com).
I read articles on web development, 
learned about web frameworks such as [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and [PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org/),
and even built a templating library called [RAFT](https://github.com/ianli/raft) in PHP.

Academics have plenty of things to keep them busy:
conducting studies, analyzing data, publishing papers, and applying for grants.
The last thing that a busy academic wants to do is spend a lot of time creating a website.

ElbowPatched is here to help!
The following are some of the features of ElbowPatched that I\'m working on:

* A web interface to add and edit your publications, research information, and news. You will also be able to add links to videos of your talks, slides of your presentation.
* Select from a collection of themes to customize and personalize your website.
* Publish your website on your custom domain, your university URL, or on ElbowPatched.

ElbowPatched is in progress.
I will document its development on this website.
