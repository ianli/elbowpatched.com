Two weeks ago, I [discovered](http://www.elbowpatched.com/posts/tools-and-services.html)
that many academics I know hand-coded their personal websites.
I was surprised by this because creating a website takes a lot of time and academics are very busy people.

There must be a way to reduce the amount of time it takes to make a personal website. 
For this purpose, I created [Elbowpatched Boilerplate](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate),
a template to make it easier to create an academic personal website.
It is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 
and has the following features that make it easier to create an academic personal website.

* Fill out simple [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files with information about yourself, your publications, projects, and presentations.
* Use the provided templates or create your own to change the presentation of your content.
* Publish your website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free.

Elbowpatched project is a work-in-progress,
so it currently only has one layout that you can use: 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html).
You can preview what the layout looks like [here](http://ianli.github.io/elbowpatched-boilerplate/).
I will add more layouts as this project progresses.
