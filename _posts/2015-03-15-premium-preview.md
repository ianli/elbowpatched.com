In the past few months, I've been busy working on ElbowPatched Premium,
a new service that helps you create a beautiful academic website without taking much time from your already busy schedule.
The premium version has some benefits over [ElbowPatched Boilerplate](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate):

* A user interface to make it easy to edit your academic profile.
* A collection of beautiful themes to customize your academic website.
* Publish your site on a custom domain or under your university domain.

The following are some screenshots of ElbowPatched Premium:

#### Edit your profile
