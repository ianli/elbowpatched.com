In the past few days, a bunch of people started using [ElbowPatched Boilerplate](http://ianli.github.io/elbowpatched-boilerplate)
thanks to the generous [tweet by Arfon Smith (@arfon)](https://twitter.com/arfon/status/557964384652099584) commending the idea behind the project.
It feels great to know that people are finding value on something that you worked on.
It&rsquo;s a similar feeling that I get when researchers build on [my research in graduate school](http://www.ianli.com/research).
I&rsquo;m sure many academics feel the same way when their research inspires other projects.

Here&rsquo;s a list of academic websites that currently use ElbowPatched Boilerplate.
It's an eclectic mix of research, so peruse them for some inspiration.

* [Guillaume Lobet](http://www.guillaumelobet.be)

This year, I also made sure to find time to work on the ElbowPatched service.
I'm building the service using the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework,
which I haven't used since version 2.3.2.
The framework is now on version 4.2.0, so there's plenty of things to learn.
My goal is to finish an alpha version that people could start playing with.
People who signed up for the invite list will get first dibs on the invites.
