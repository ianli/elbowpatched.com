title:  "What tools and services did you use to make your academic personal website?"

I posted this question to my friends in academia on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ianli/status/499930278379261952) and Facebook: 

> What tools and services did you use to make your academic personal website?

Most people responded that they hand-coded their websites: writing HTML markup, CSS styles, and Javascript code. 
I wasn\'t surprised by this since most academics I know are from computer science departments 
where they likely experienced some web development.

What surprised me was that they _chose_ to hand-code their website, which takes a lot of time.
Time that academics also have to use for other important research tasks, 
such as reading papers, conducting studies, analyzing data, and writing papers.

However, I could understand the motivation to invest time on an academic personal website.
An academic personal website is your public face on the Internet where you have full control over the type of content you show and how it\'s presented.
You don\'t get the same flexibility with other services,
such as, [Academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu), [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net), and [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com).

There must be a better way to quickly create personal academic websites
and allow people to maintain control over the presentation of their content.
Perhaps a [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) specifically designed for academics, 
or a template that academics could use to quickly publish a website.
I will be exploring these solutions with Elbowpatched.

P.S. I expect that if I had asked this question to academics in less computing-intensive departments, 
I would have received different answers. 
If you\'re experience with your academic personal website is different from the answers I received above, 
please send me a message on [Twitter (@ianli)](https://twitter.com/ianli),
I\'d appreciate to know what tools/services you use.
