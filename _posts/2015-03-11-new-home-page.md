I'm excited to share with you the visual redesign of the [ElbowPatched home page](http://www.elbowpatched.com).
The logomark, logotype, color palette, and layout are all new.

#### Logomark

The logomark is an owl composed of squares set at 45&deg;.

#### Logotype

The logotype uses the open-source sans serif font [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/)
designed by [≈Åukasz Dziedzic](http://www.latofonts.com/team/).

#### Color palette

#### The future

I wanted to improve the visual aesthetics of the ElbowPatched home page
to better reflect the mission of ElbowPatched to help academics create beautiful websites.
This new visual identity will guide the future interfaces of ElbowPatched.
